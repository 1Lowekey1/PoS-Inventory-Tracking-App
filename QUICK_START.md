# ⚡ QUICK START GUIDE

## 🎯 Get Running in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Open the App
1. Download all 4 files to one folder
2. Double-click `index.html`
3. Opens in your browser - that's it!

### Step 2: Add Your First Ingredient

**IMPORTANT:** Enter what you actually paid for the batch!

1. Tap **Inventory** (bottom nav)
2. Tap **+ New Ingredient**
3. Example setup:
   ```
   Name: Salted Caramel Syrup
   Unit: ml
   Batch Purchase Cost: 780.00 (what you paid)
   Batch Quantity: 1000 (how much you bought)
   Unit Cost: ₱0.78/ml (auto-calculated)
   Low Stock Alert: 100
   ```
4. Tap **Save Ingredient**

**How It Works:**
- You bought 1000ml syrup for ₱780
- System calculates: ₱780 ÷ 1000ml = ₱0.78 per ml
- When a drink uses 20ml, cost = ₱0.78 × 20 = ₱15.60
- **NOT ₱780!** The batch cost is never assigned to one drink.

### Step 3: Create Your First Product
1. Tap **Products** (bottom nav)
2. Tap **+ New Product**

   ```
   Product Name: Iced Coffee
